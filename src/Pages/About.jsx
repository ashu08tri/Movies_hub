              This project is built using the <strong>TheMoviesDB API</strong> to showcase 
              detailed information about movies â€” including cast, ratings, genres, and more.

              As part of this project, I also implemented a <strong>ticket booking feature</strong>.  
              Please note that this feature is <u>for demonstration purposes only</u> and does not 
              provide real ticket booking. It is included to highlight my ability to design and 
              implement such functionality in a real-world application.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              The design follows a <strong>black and white theme</strong> to keep the interface 
              clean and cinematic, ensuring the focus remains on the movies themselves.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="h6" mt={4} align="center" fontStyle="italic">
              ðŸŽ¬ A showcase project built with React & MUI â€” explore movies like never before!
